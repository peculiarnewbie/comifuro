# comifuro

For the record I'm not a weeb. I scraped some twitter data of people posting comifuro catalogue and i made a frontend for that data

## Todo

- [ ] rewrite this shit lmao
- [ ] just use sqlite even locally
- [ ] think about deduplication
- [ ] doing dailies was a bad idea. Just do live and use tweets as checkpoints
- [ ] handle errors better and do retries
- [ ] strip the hashtags when storing
- [ ] try other search methods (vector, fuzzy, etc)
- [ ] search goodies. ignore tweets, ignore users, sort by user, sort random, filter by day, etc
- [ ] image carousel
- [ ] infinite scroll
- [ ] virtualize
- [ ] pulling metadata from r2 was stupid. just do an actual db and cache routes
